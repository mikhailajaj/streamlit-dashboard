## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: RI Utilization <70%
**Impact**: Lower savings realization  
**Mitigation**: Start with 3-year partial upfront (lower commitment), monitor weekly  
**Contingency**: RI marketplace, convertible RIs

### Risk 2: Tag Compliance Slips
**Impact**: Reduced accountability, harder chargeback  
**Mitigation**: Automated tagging reminders, make tags required for new resources  
**Contingency**: Tag on/off enforcement policies

### Risk 3: Budget Alert Fatigue
**Impact**: Team ignores alerts, overspending continues  
**Mitigation**: Set realistic thresholds, escalation paths, actionable recommendations  
**Contingency**: Automated cost controls (future enhancement)

### Risk 4: Team Resistance
**Impact**: Slow adoption, features underutilized  
**Mitigation**: Executive sponsorship, clear value communication, celebrate wins  
**Contingency**: Phased rollout, pilot teams first
